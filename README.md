Affiliate reward application.

Logic
-----------

Basic affiliate program logic:

When a "customer_#A" that had registered via an affiliate link of
"Person_#B" has a parcel forwarded via our company, "Person_#B" receives
10% of all the service fees that "customer_#A" has payed + 1% of all the
postage for forwarded parcel.

All the commission money that "Person_#B" earns are deposited to a
separate "affiliate balance" . Money from affiliate balance can be
transfered to a regular account balance or be withdrawn via PayPal or
Bank Money Transfer
